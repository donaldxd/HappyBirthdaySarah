# Happy Birthday Sarah
This is a simple little, jQuery based, website I made for my girlfriend several years ago. If you just open up index.html in a browser you'll see 95% of what the site was.
  
I wrote this many years ago and it was one of my first experiences with JS and jQuery. So code quality might not meet my current standards.  
  

# Missing stuff
Some of the youtube videos no longer exist, and I purposely removed the music in fear of the RIAA (oh no!)

# License
This site is licensed under the MIT license, for the most part have at it!
